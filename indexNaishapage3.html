ALL ABOUT AMPHIBIANS

Did you know that most amphibians have thin,moist skin that helps them to breathe and that no other group of animals has this special skin? 
If not then you should surely read along to know about more of these unique creatures! The axolotl, Ambystoma mexicanum, 
is a paedomorphic salamander related to the tiger salamander.
The species was originally found in several lakes, such as Lake Xochimilco underlying Mexico City.
Axolotls are unusual among amphibians in that they reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis.
